updated 2022-04-09




Instructions

Unzipping creates a PolyWorks folder.
If PolyWorks does not detect your Soldat directory on startup, go to Edit -> Preferences and set it there.
If you don't have Soldat installed you can create a folder with the Maps, Scenery-gfx, and Textures directories.

Requirements: Windows 98/Me/2000/XP/Vista/7/8/10/11; DirectX 8.1




FAQ

01. What is PolyWorks?
PolyWorks is a map editor for Soldat.

02. Where can I get the latest version of PolyWorks?
The latest test version can be found on irc in the #soldat.polyworks channel on quakenet.

03. Why is there no help file?
There is now :D

05. Can you make polys go behind the player?
No, this isn't possible in Soldat.

06. The Palette/Scenery/Display window doesn't show, and it's checked off in the Window Menu.
Try Window -> Workspace -> Reset Window Locations.

07. Can you make the controls like in MapMaker?
No. You'll get used to it.

08. How do I put multiple textures in my map?
Put two or more textures into a bitmap and use the texture tool to manipulate the texture coordinates.

09. I get this error when I try to run PolyWorks: System Error &H8007007E (-2147024770). The specified module could not be found. (Or any 'missing file' type errors.)
Make sure these files exist in your Windows\System32 folder: MBMouse.ocx, COMDLG32.OCX, mscomctl.ocx, msvbvm60.dll, dx8vb.dll, scrrun.dll. The first three are included in the PolyWorks zip, the others can be found with google. If putting them in the Windows\System32 folder doesn't work try resistering the missing files: start -> run, type in regsvr32 name_of_file.dll_or_ocx.

10. I get a runtime error when I start PolyWorks.
Try changing the Dir entry in the Preferences section in polyworks.ini to your Soldat directory.

11. Are there poly bugs in maps made with PolyWorks?
In PolyWorks the "bouncy poly" bug has been eliminated (where polys would randomly turn bouncy along the edge after compiling). Poly bugs associated with vertices still occur, but they are easy to prevent with correct poly placement. Read the Map Maker Manual for more info.

12. I get a Direct3D initialization error when I start PolyWorks.
Make sure your color setting is either 16-bit or 32-bit (control panel -> display -> settings tab).

13. There is no scenery in my scenery window!
Right click with the scenery tool to bring up the main scenery list.
