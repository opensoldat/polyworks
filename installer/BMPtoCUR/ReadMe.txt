Converts a 32x32 bitmap into a monochrome cursor.
Colors consist of black and white, transparency, and invert.

1. Load a bitmap (or other image file)
2. Set the hot spot (15,15 for default PolyWorks cursors)
3. Click "Make CUR" (a .cur file with the same name as the source file is created in the same directory.)

Has not been tested extensively and doesn't have much error handling, use at your own risk :P
