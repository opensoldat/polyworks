# Soldat PolyWorks
Soldat map editor

## Requirements
* Visual Basic 6 SP6

## Notes
When VB6 is installed, it may have issues finding referenced controls, such as "MBMouse.ocx".
You have to add them manually out of the /pwinstall folder.

If you want to contribute while using Visual Studio 2015 update 1+, you may need this addon:

(You will still need VB6 for compilation)
