Requirements
------------
* Visual Basic 6 SP6
* NSIS (optional - for generating the Installer)
* rcedit or Resource Hacker (optional - for replacing the old icon)

Notes
-----
When VB6 is installed, it may have issues finding referenced controls, such as "MBMouse.ocx".
You have to add them manually out of the /pwinstall folder.

If you want to contribute while using Visual Studio 2015 update 1+, you may need this addon:

(You will still need VB6 for compilation)
